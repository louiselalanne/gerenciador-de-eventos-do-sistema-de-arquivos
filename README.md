# File System Event Manager üêï‚Äçü¶∫

Operating systems keep track of all the files present on the system.
This helps to keep track of malicious files, such as viruses, that are downloaded over the network. Viruses modify existing files or delete important files to corrupt the system!
Automating the process of tracking changes to the system helps you track whether such activities did or did not happen!
